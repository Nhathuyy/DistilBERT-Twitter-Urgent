Implementation of DistilBERT Model for Classifying Urgent Posts on Twitter

DistilBERT for Twitter Urgent Post Classification
This repository contains the implementation of a DistilBERT model for classifying urgent posts on Twitter. The goal of this project is to automatically categorize Twitter posts into two classes: urgent and non-urgent. The implementation utilizes the power of the DistilBERT model, a distilled version of the BERT model, to achieve efficient and accurate classification.

Overview
In today's fast-paced world, social media platforms like Twitter play a crucial role in spreading information rapidly. However, distinguishing urgent and non-urgent posts can be challenging due to the vast volume of content shared daily. This project aims to address this challenge by building a classification model using the DistilBERT architecture.

Colab Notebook
To run this project, you can use the provided Colab notebook. Colab is an excellent platform for running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud without the need for local installations.

Here's how you can get started:

Open the Colab notebook in your browser.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the environment and load the necessary data.
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the DistilBERT model, and evaluate its performance.
Model Architecture
The DistilBERT model leverages the transformer architecture, which excels at understanding contextual relationships in natural language. The transformer architecture's self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text, enabling it to capture intricate language patterns.

Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By comparing the model's predictions with the ground truth labels, we can assess its ability to correctly classify urgent and non-urgent posts.

Future Enhancements
This project serves as a starting point for utilizing DistilBERT for urgent post classification on Twitter. Future enhancements could include:

Fine-tuning the model on specific domains or languages.
Experimenting with different hyperparameters to improve performance.
Building a user-friendly web interface for real-time classification.
